# 1516_SickCircuitSolver

This repository is for our 2015-16 CSE project. The project is a website that will help students learn about Electrcity, Magnetism, and DC Circuits. The user will be able to build complex circuits and the website will then give the user any and all of the requisite information. The website will also contain notes, quizlets, interactive lessons, and tests about Electricity and Magnetism. The goal of this website is to help current physics students understand the E&M portion of their school year, and help them with some of the more complicated problems they may encounter.

This repository is also being used for PLTW Project 1.4.7, a photo mosaic creator.

The file 1.4.7 loop.py is the final version of the photo mosaic creator.
