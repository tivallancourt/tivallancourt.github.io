<p class = "tutorial">
	In order to "solve" a simple circuit, one must obtain the total voltage, resistance, and current of the circuit, as well as the individual voltage, resistance and current of each component in the circuit. In this tutorial, the various aspects of circuits, applicable equations, and ways to solve simple circuits will be discussed. After the tutorial, there are some flashcards to help you study or quiz yourself.

	<i>Voltage:</i>
	Voltage can be defined as the electric potential energy per unit charge. As a result, the units of this quantity is "joules per coulomb", which is commonly referred to as volts. Voltage is also known as "electric potential". In a series circuit, voltage experiences drops in strength after passing through components, like a resistor. However, the sum of these voltages is equivalent to the total voltage in a series circuit. In a parallel circuit, the voltage is equal across each branch (assuming thre)

	<i>Resistance:</i>
	<br>
	<i>Current:</i>

	What is current? Current measures the flow of charge through a circuit. The units for current is a Coulomb per second. The SI base unit for current is the Ampere, or "Amp", which has the symbol A. In a series circuit, the amount of current through each component is the same. However, in a parallel circuit, the current through each component changes.
